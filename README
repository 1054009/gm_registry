    gm_registry
===================

Brings back the recently removed debug registry. Restores the original functionality of ``debug.getregistry()`` and adds a new global _R.

NOTE: The registry was removed for a reason, there are multiple security vulnerabilities surrounding it. Use at your own risk.
